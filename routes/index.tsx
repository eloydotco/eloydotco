          I'm Eloy, welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is my place to
          gather all my stuff, share recommendations, and, eventually, start
          posting my own thoughts.

          Personally, I am a very curious person, a dog lover and a lovely
          husband. I born in Galicia (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸), but currently living in Boston, MA
          (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).

          Professionally, I started my carrer as Software Engineer back on 2016,
          and, since then, I have played different roles among different
