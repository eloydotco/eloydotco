Hey there!

I'm Eloy, welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is my place to gather all my stuff, share recommendations, and, eventually, start posting my own thoughts.

Personally, I am a very curious person, a dog lover and a lovely husband. I born in Galicia (🇪🇸), but currently living in Boston, MA (🇺🇸).

Professionally, I started my carrer as Software Engineer back on 2016, and, since then, I have played different roles among different companies and projects. You can find all my experience on [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/eloy-castelo/).

If you would like to connect to me personally and/or professionally, do not hesitate to reach me out at [hi@eloy.co](mailto:hi@eloy.co).

Kind regards,
E.
